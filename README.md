# S3 Upload Action

This is a GitHub Action that uploads a file to Amazon S3.
Uploaded files can be accessed via HTTP (Use [presigned URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html) for private s3 buckets).
Currently, only single file upload is supported.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aws-access-key-id` | (Required) Your AWS access key ID. | |
| `aws-secret-access-key` | (Required) Your AWS secret access key. | |
| `aws-region` | (Required) Region where the bucket is located. | |
| `aws-bucket` | (Required) S3 bucket to upload files. | |
| `file-path` | (Required) Path of the file to upload, eg `./myfile.txt` | |
| `destination-dir` | Directory on the bucket to upload files. If you don't want to apply anything, specify `/`. | 32 random alphanumeric characters |
| `bucket-root` | Root directory on the bucket to upload files. Useful for separating objects in buckets that are not related to this action. If you don't want to apply anything, specify `/`. | `artifacts` |
| `output-file-url` | Add the URL of the file to the output of this action. | `false` |
| `content-type` | Specify the contents of the 'Content-type' header when downloading the file, eg `image/png`. | |

| `qr-width` | QR code image width pixels. Specify `100` to `1000`. | `120` |
| `public` | If `false` is specified, [ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#canned-acl) is set to 'private' and presigned URL is used. Basically should be `false` for private buckets. | `false` |
| `expire` | Expiration seconds for presigned URL. Specify `0` to `604800`(1 week). | `604800` |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |

## Usage

### Basic usage

```yaml
- uses: kfird214/s3-upload-action@v2.1
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: 'ap-northeast-1'
    aws-bucket: ${{ secrets.AWS_BUCKET }}
    file-path: './myfile.txt'
```

In this example, `myfile.txt` is stored in `artifacts/<32 random characters>/myfile.txt` on the bucket.
Specify `destination-dir` input or `bucket-root` input to change the destination.

### URL of the uploaded file

Use `file-url` output.

```yaml
- uses: kfird214/s3-upload-action@v2.1
  id: upload # specify some ID for use in subsequent steps
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: 'ap-northeast-1'
    aws-bucket: ${{ secrets.AWS_BUCKET }}
    file-path: './myfile.txt'
    output-file-url: 'true' # specify true
- name: Show URL
  run: echo '${{ steps.upload.outputs.file-url }}' # use this output
```

When uploading an image and displaying it on a browser, specify `image/png` etc. for `content-type` input.
For Android apk file, you can install it on your device by specifying `application/vnd.android.package-archive`.

> [!NOTE]  
> If `public` input is set to `true` and presigned URL is applied, the AWS access key ID will be included in the URL.
> Therefore, if you manage that ID with [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions), be aware that when you display or output something on GitHub, part of the URL will be masked as `***`.

### URL of the generated QR code image

Use `qr-url` output.

```yaml
- uses: kfird214/s3-upload-action@v2.1
  id: upload # specify some ID for use in subsequent steps
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: 'ap-northeast-1'
    aws-bucket: ${{ secrets.AWS_BUCKET }}
    file-path: './myfile.txt'
    output-qr-url: 'true' # specify true
- name: Show URL
  run: echo '${{ steps.upload.outputs.qr-url }}' # use this output
```

Specify `qr-width` input to change the size of the QR code image.

QR code image sample:

## Publish file to public

If `false` is specified for the `public` input, ACL is set to 'private' and presigned URL is used.
However, the expiration date of the presigned URL is up to one week (It can also be shortened by specifying the `expire` input).

If you don't want to set the expiration date, you can get the normal URL without authentication by specifying `true` for the `public` input (Bucket side settings are also required to make it public).
